Beta-app for learning new words.

Don't try to open this application anywhere except Android Studio, otherwise you will receive error messages.

Give the application permission to write and read files from external storage (app will request it itself).

Don't judge strictly, this is my first Android application for the public.

Caution! High content of shit-code!!!
